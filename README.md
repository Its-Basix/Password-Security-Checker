Wrote a module password verification program in Python to check passwords according to length, character variety, common password lists, and entropy.

Mathematically calculated entropy to estimate the unguessable nature of passwords.

Produced human-readable feedback and overall strength score.

Designed with the use of clean modular functions, best practices including main() entry point, tuple returns and no global state.
